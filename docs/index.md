Some code and problems solved in [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org) in relation to:

* Probability, random variables, probability distributions and probability models, and their relevance to statistical inference.
* Standard probability models formulation. 
* Properties of probability distributions, moment generating functions, variable transformations and conditional expectations to analyse common random variables and probability models.
* Basic ideas of estimation and hypothesis testing
* fit probability models to data by both estimating and testing hypotheses about model parameters.
* Underlying statistical theory of linear models and the limitations of such models.
* Fit linear models to data using R and interpret the results.
* Prediction (or classification) qualitative responses.
* Bayesian statistics.
* EM algorithm in simple settings.
